# Four-Thieves

Four Thieves is a top down dungeon crawler that takes place in a medieval fantasy world. Set in Black Hallows, this dangerous realm has dungeons, monsters, and magic. Those who dare to reside in the Hallows must join a guild when coming of age. One must swear fealty to their guild. They become more than friends, they become family. The Thieves Guild are tasked with mapping out and exploring the treacherous dungeons, yet are allowed to keep any discovered treasure. Only the most elite are recruited to join the Thieves guild.
