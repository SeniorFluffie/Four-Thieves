# Four-Thieves

Four Thieves is a top down dungeon crawler that takes place in a medieval fantasy world. Set in Black Hallows, this dangerous realm has dungeons, monsters, and magic. Those who dare to reside in the Hallows must join a guild when coming of age. One must swear fealty to their guild. They become more than friends, they become family. The Thieves Guild are tasked with mapping out and exploring the treacherous dungeons, yet are allowed to keep any discovered treasure. Only the most elite are recruited to join the Thieves guild.

Design documentation on this project can be found in the PDF located in the master branch. All the artwork and audio can be found on https://opengameart.org/. We would like to thank the many artists, designers, and musicians that were able to make this game possible due to their open-licensed content.

Four Thieves was the final project designed for a first year 'Introduction to Computer Game Design' course at Carleton University.
